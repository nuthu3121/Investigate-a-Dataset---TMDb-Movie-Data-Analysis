# Investigate-a-Dataset---TMDb-Movie-Data-Analysis
This is the first project in udacity data analyst nanodegree program.

**Dataset**

In this project, I chose the TMDb movie dataset, which consisted of approximately 10,000 movies movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). Some of the features 
included user ratings and revenues generated from the movies. 

**Python Libraries to install**

You will need to have python installed as well as the following libraries
- pandas
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- csv

Alternatively, you can have Python Anaconda installed (select python 3.6 when installing Anaconda)

**Why this Project?**

The main aim of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use numpy, pandas and matplotlib to draw insights into the data. In particular, the project involved 
brainstorming possible questions that could be asnwered using the dataset and answering them using descriptive statistics and visualization. In addition, the project 
required one to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. 

**Lesson Learnt**

- Understanding all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Learning how to pose questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Learning how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Gaining experience on communicating the results of your analysis
- Increasing ability to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Increasing knowledge on working with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Learning how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
